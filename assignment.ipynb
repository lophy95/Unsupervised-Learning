We will be using the facebook live sellers dataset for Task 1 & 2 of the assignment and here is a brief context about the same - The data is about live selling feature on the Facebook platform. Each record consists of information about the time live information of sale is posted to Facebook and engagements in the data. The engagements are regular Facebook interactions such as share and emotion rection.\n",
